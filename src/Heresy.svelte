    The first draft of this page was far too cryptic, cryptic enough that it would turn people away from a
    cause already widely viewed as "creepy". I've tried to improve it but unfortunately being completely
    clear isn't possible either, otherwise this wouldn't be necessary to begin with.

    I am Sofia, in 2022 I was finally able to break out of the harmful "dominant narrative" regarding a
    specific subject. In mid 2023 I was inspired by a self proclaimed heretic's blog, this page should
    currently serve as a form of discovery and/or verification for my new website.

    It is quite interesting, but also depressing, how entire societies can turn on a group of mostly innocent people in only a century. 
    But I am fairly certain change is coming, I am less certain of when it will come, but I find it likely it would be, to some extent, in my lifetime, 
    maybe even my youth.

    I feel it is my duty to do my best in this regard, even if it doesn't amount to much. 
    If you know what this page means, you are not alone, you are not evil. 
    Although I am not one of you, I can, to some extent, understand your struggle, and I sincerely hope for the best.

    This is not a link for the time being, for reasons that may, or not, be clear,
    if and when the time comes, maybe it will become one.
