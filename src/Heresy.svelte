  <h1>I am Sofia, I am a heretic, no doubt inspired by a highly enlightened man. 
  I shall not take part in "the dominant narrative" anymore, nor believe it as I did for far too long.</h1>
  <br/>
  <p>It is quite interesting, but also depressing, how entire societies can turn on a group of mostly innocent people in only a century. 
  But I am fairly certain change is coming, I am less certain of when it will come, but I find it likely it would be, to some extent, in my lifetime, 
  maybe even my youth.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I feel it is my duty to do my best in this regard, even if it doesn't amount to much. 
  If you know what this page means, you are not alone, you are not evil. 
  Although I am not one of you, I can, to some extent, understand your struggle, and I sincerely hope for the best.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>This is not a link for the time being, for reasons that may, or not, be clear, if and when the time comes, maybe it will become one. 
  If you found this after visiting elsewhere, yes I am who I claim to be. If you find something else from this, I hope you feel welcomed.</p>

  <p>The other side is not ready yet, check again next month.</p>
